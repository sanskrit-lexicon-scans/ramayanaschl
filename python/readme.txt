Convert the tab-delimited index file into a json object,
python make_js_index.py Schlegel.Ramayana.index.for.pdf-linking.txt index.js
803 Page records read from Schlegel.Ramayana.index.for.pdf-linking.txt
1193 lines written to index.js



Manually added 'indexdata='  to this json object, for use in main.js.

cp index.js ../ksverse.js

Note: the pdf only had pages thru 338, and pages 335-338 are poor.
But the index has additional pages 339-358.
Where are these pages available?
